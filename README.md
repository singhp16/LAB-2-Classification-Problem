This project applies three supervised machine learning models—Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Tree—to classify coffee shop daily revenue into categorical levels: Low, Medium, and High. Using a structured dataset of 2,000 observations with features like customer count, order value, employee count, and foot traffic, the goal is to predict revenue categories to support decision-making in small business operations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps to understand data distribution and feature relationships.

The continuous revenue target was converted into three categories using quantile binning to frame the task as a classification problem. The dataset was preprocessed with scaling and one-hot encoding, followed by an 80/20 stratified split for model training. All three models were trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy at 85%, followed by Decision Tree at 79% and k-NN at 77%. While all models performed well on "Low" and "High" classes, the "Medium" class showed more overlap and misclassification, particularly for k-NN.

This repository includes the full Jupyter/Colab notebook with step-by-step implementation, a Word document and optional PDF report in APA format, and all generated visualizations. Confusion matrices and classification reports are also provided for clarity. This work illustrates how basic classification algorithms can yield actionable insights for retail forecasting and revenue planning. Users can clone the repository, install the required packages, and reproduce the results directly from the notebook.# LAB-2-Classification-Problem
